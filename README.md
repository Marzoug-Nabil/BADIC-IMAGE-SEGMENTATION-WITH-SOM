# Basic Segmentation with SOM

This repository presents an implementation of basic segmentation using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), an artificial neural network technique. SOM is employed to partition and classify data, particularly useful in tasks like clustering and segmentation.

## Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)

Self-Organizing Maps, or SOM, are a type of artificial neural network that performs unsupervised learning. They organize and project high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space, typically a 2D grid, in a way that reflects the topological properties of the input space. SOM is known for preserving the topology of the input space and is widely used for tasks like clustering and dimensionality reduction.


## Usage

To perform basic segmentation with SOM, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation:**

Prepare your data for segmentation.

2. **Training the SOM:**

Train the Self-Organizing Map using your data.

3. **Segmentation:**

Apply the trained SOM to segment and classify data points.
